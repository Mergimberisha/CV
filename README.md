## Skills


#### Communication
I achieved my communication skills while completing my software development Apprenticeship, which involved creating a website using coding knowledge. I further developed these skills when I had to communicate with the clients to meet their conditions. This also meant talking, sprint meetings, MVP and also tickets to create a fully working website with a colleague. This improved my communication skills while working at Makers as teamwork is a major part and without communication, projects would not be completed to the standard expected.
#### Time Management

I achieved time management skills at the Apprenticeship due to us having a deadline for a fully working website for clients. This skill massively improved at Makers as we had independent projects to finish by the end of the week or day. This helped me massively by teaching me how to plan well and go about the project. Meaning tickets could be planned to create an MVP by a specific time and if completed on time or earlier then I would have other ideas which I could add to make the project better and show my knowledge.

#### Creativity
My creativity skills improved massively when doing group projects at Makers. When introduced to a group project we would immediately gather in a group to create a board and put all our ideas down. Hearing other people's ideas helped me become more creative as I now had a better understanding of how there are no limits to creativity. In every group project, we had some part of my idea and in some cases, my idea would be used to create the project as it was creative and something unique to create.

#### Problem-solving
I love problem-solving situations as it interests me to learn and try to sort out the problem. At Makers, I came past a lot of challenges learning new languages. Doing my research to try and find out what the problem is would help my knowledge and improve my independent skills. When working on a group project which was set by makers we came across a huge problem which affected all of our work, when merging our work all of our tests would fail. I took the initiative to try and find out what the problem was, After thorough research, I came across a similar problem which wouldn't solve our issues but using the same knowledge as that person and using mine I finally managed to add a code to all the tests and they all passed which was an amazing relief.
